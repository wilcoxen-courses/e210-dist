# Distributional Analysis Questions

1. Looking at the results for income quintiles when the types are 
grouped together (the results with "all" for the type), is the tax 
progressive, proportional, or regressive? How can you tell? What is the 
difference in ETR between the lowest quintile and highest quintile? Note 
that it's fine to calculate that with a calculator: you don't need to 
build it into the script.

TBD

2. Now look at the results for types when all incomes are grouped 
together (the results with "all" for quint). Do the ETRs differ? If 
so, say a little about what you see.

TBD 

3. Now look at the detailed results that are disaggregated by both
type and quintile. Within any given type does the tax look progressive, 
proportional, or regressive? What is the difference between the 
ETRs of the highest and lowest quintiles for each group? As above, 
using a calculator is fine for this.

TBD

4. If an analyst failed to calculate the detailed results and looked only 
at the ETRs by overall quintile (question 1), would they overstate or 
understate the policy's progressivity or regressivity? Briefly explain. If 
possible, also explain why it happens using the insights above.

TBD
